# Intelligent User Interfaces Project

This repository contains the code handling the Alexa Skill request, passing it to the NLP-Unit and the Recommender-System and lastly back to the lambda function.
The sample_alexa_request.json contains the content as passed from the skill to the lambda function and simulates the skill interaction.
